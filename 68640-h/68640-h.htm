PUBLISHERS' PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
Mr. R. C. Caldwell, the lamented author of these
humourous papers, was the eldest son of Dr. Caldwell,
the great Missionary Bishop of Tinnevelly.  He was
originally intended for the Ministry, and went through
a course of Theological study at St. Augustine's
College, Canterbury.  After passing out of College, he
returned to India and worked zealously and assiduously
in the Mission field in Trichinopoly and Tanjore.
For some reasons, perhaps known to himself alone,
Mr. Caldwell did not take Orders but elected to
become a journalist as being more congenial to his
tastes.  Mr. Caldwell was known in England as a
frequent contributor to the English Journals,&mdash;the
<i>London Daily News</i>, the <i>Athenæum</i>, the <i>Contemporary
Review</i>, the <i>Illustrated London News</i> and
even <i>Punch</i>.  Some Ballads and Songs he had then
written were set to music by one of the most popular
composers of the day and produced on the stage.
His "Chutney Lyrics"&mdash;some twelve of which were
originally contributed to the <i>Madras Athenæum and
Daily News</i>,&mdash;first prominently brought him to notice
in India.  On leaving the Mission Mr. Caldwell took
up for a short time the co-editorship of the <i>Madras
Times</i> and then transferred his services to the
<i>Athenæum and Daily News</i> of which he was for a
short period sole editor.  He conducted the latter
journal most successfully, but the general complaint
against him was too much personality in his writings.
His weekly "<i>Chit Chat</i>" gave offence to not a few,
though all willingly conceded that these papers
afforded much amusement and effected considerable
good in exposing many of the evils that then existed
in Madras.  Mr. Caldwell was subsequently employed
by the Newspaper press of the Bombay and Bengal
Presidencies and by the wit and humour of his
writings gained extensive popularity.  He died in
harness in April or May 1878.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We reproduce "Chutney Lyrics" with the eight
other comic pieces published in 1871 as their
popularity has not diminished and they are frequently
enquired for.  We trust that this present edition will
meet with a renewal of the favor so readily accorded
to the previous edition.

  Sir R-ch-rd T-mpl-'s Ghost.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was midnight dark and dreary;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sitting lone and weary,<br />
  And, on public projects brooding, my poor head was aching sore:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When into my chamber striding<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came a sable stranger gliding,<br />
  Then, without pretence at hiding, squatted on the matted floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatted calmly on the floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatted; grinned,&mdash;and nothing more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting up, I eyed the native<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an aspect legislative,<br />
  Saying sternly, "Off thou caitiff! know'st thou ME, vile blackamoor?"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the intruder, nought replying,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought asserting, nought denying,<br />
  Silent sat, my motions eyeing, chewing betel as before;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatting on the matted floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chewing, grinning,&mdash;nothing more!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wretch!" I cried, with wrath rampageous,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This your conduct's quite outrageous.<br />
  Get thee gone, or I will thump thee, thou audacious blackamoor!"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the stranger, nothing caring,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his daring ghostly bearing,<br />
  With his grinning, and his staring, madden'd me still more and more,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatting on the matted floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chewing betel,&mdash;nothing more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there rose in me a terror,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought I, "Are my eyes in error?<br />
  It is surely some black phantom come from Dreamland's shadowy shore;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis a Ghoul, or Shape of evil,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lemure, Spectre, Imp, or Devil,<br />
  Wont to hold fantastic revel in the brain's distracted core:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing squats upon that floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis my fancy,&mdash;nothing more!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning then, the Shape unheeding,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight I sat me down to reading,<br />
  Reading Balance Sheets, whereover 'twas my duty then to pore:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But:&mdash;'twas strange&mdash;methought the figures<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took to dancing sudden jiggers,<br />
  Like a troupe of dancing niggers, whirling, twirling, more and more;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the phantom from the floor<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose and watched them,&mdash;nothing more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bogie!" said I, "You're right gracious!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you think me too audacious<br />
  If I ask you what your name is, since we've never met before?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you hail from hell or heaven?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know a certain raven<br />
  That appeared, like you, one even, to the Poet of Lenore?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me, Mr. Blackamoor,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me this, and nothing more!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grinning still, but still naught heeding,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood that silent Stranger reading,<br />
  Reading to himself the figures my Financial Statement bore.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fool!" I cried exasperated,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is your curious humour sated?<br />
  You will not seem so elated when I kick you through that door!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, or quit my matted floor!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's your business, blackamoor!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now, that spectre sable<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snatched <i>The Budget</i> from my table;<br />
  Through THE SURPLUS with his finger drew a broad phosphoric score,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, while steamed a sulph'rous vapour,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrote in phosphorus on the paper&mdash;<br />
  DEFICIT!&mdash;then with a caper, straight evanished through the floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished through the matted floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing brimstone,&mdash;nothing more!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled and thrilled with trembling wonder,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith, with a voice of thunder,<br />
  "Boy!" I cried, "Bring me some cognac!"&mdash;and the Boy some cognac bore:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, from me, I know that never<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits shall that Spirit sever,<br />
  Though adown my throat for ever, peg on peg I wildly pour.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still that phantom, o'er and o'er,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFICIT! writes evermore.<br />

  The Jollipore Ball<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  At Jollipore lived a sleek Parsee,&mdash;<br />
  RUNNYDASS, RUMMYBHOY, CURSETJEE.<br />
  With keeping the only shop of the Station,<br />
  He united a Sowcar's occupation.<br />
  A plump little man, with a waddling walk,<br />
  In mien most mild, most courteous in talk;<br />
  If you caught him cheating, you'd only smile,<br />
  He did it in <i>such</i> a pleasant style,&mdash;<br />
  As if he were only striving to please<br />
  By accepting from you a few rupees!<br />
  Ah not without meaning did Nature place<br />
  That keen little eye in that smooth sleek face,<br />
  That restless, inquisitive, hungry eye,<br />
  Which nothing could pass unscrutinized by!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone midst Hindoos, he lived like Hindoos,<br />
  Dressed in turband, and cloths, and light-yellow shoes,<br />
  Ruby and diamond rings gleamed on his hands:<br />
  He was rich in gold, and houses, and lands:<br />
  Massive chains on his person he wore,<br />
  And all knew his Phaeton in Jollipore.<br />
  When at evening he drove his pair of Pegus<br />
  He received low salaams from all the Hindoos;<br />
  And a nod from the Sahibs, as if to say,<br />
  'That's a good sort of fellow in his small way.'<br />
  Now Rummybhoy had his own aims in view<br />
  As stouter and sleeker and richer he grew.<br />
  "By Master's favour I'll rise," thought he,<br />
  "And be called by the Sahibs <i>the Model Parsee</i>.<br />
  And then&mdash;who knows&mdash;I may rise and rise,<br />
  And receive some tremendous, unlook'd for prize.<br />
  There's SIR SALAH JONG, there's SIR MADAVA ROW,<br />
  I dare say I'm richer than both of them now,<br />
  Then why should I not, too, rise to be<br />
  The great SIR RUMMYBHOY CURSETJEE?<br />
  Ha!&mdash;Good!&mdash;Let me think!&mdash;as the first step of all,<br />
  I'll give&mdash;yes&mdash;next week&mdash;a great GRAND BALL!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He announced his scheme.  To each gent in the station<br />
  He made a little verandah-oration.<br />
  To the Collector he said, "If Master please,<br />
  I will give for this Ball one thousand rupees."<br />
  A committee was formed of three or four<br />
  Of the leading gentry of Jollipore.<br />
  In their hands the Parsee entrusted all<br />
  The arrangements required for the forthcoming Ball,<br />
  They tasted the Champagne beforehand to see<br />
  It was real Simpkin, not gooseberry.<br />
  (Afterwards Rummybhoy used to say<br />
  Six dozens disappeared in this mild way!)<br />
  They issued the '<i>invites</i>.'  At length the night came<br />
  Which should inaugurate Rummybhoy's fame.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O what a rare sight was the "Public Hall"<br />
  On the night of the famous Jollipore Ball!<br />
  From above colour'd lamps their lustre flung;<br />
  And around gay flags and curtains were hung.<br />
  From the roof silk cloths, white, crimson, and gold,<br />
  Here tastefully droop'd in some elegant fold:<br />
  Whilst there some leafy device might be seen,<br />
  Whence grapes in cluster fell purple and green.<br />
  Each window'd recess of the Hall was a bower<br />
  Of pomegranates in fruit, and pomegranates in flower.<br />
  The doors were festoon'd with hollyhocks,<br />
  Rose, tuberose, myrtle, verbena, and phlox.<br />
  And creepers in flower, with tendrils of vine,<br />
  Around the pillars were taught to twine.<br />
  And now on the well-wax'd boarded floor<br />
  Throng'd the fair and the elite of Jollipore:<br />
  Twenty-six gentlemen, ladies eighteen,<br />
  Lent a life and a soul to the pleasant scene.<br />
  Merry music, fair forms in movement light,<br />
  And lovely faces aglow with delight.<br />
  There supporting the fragile Emily Moore<br />
  Whirl'd Snaffle, the pride of his cavalry corps.<br />
  Here Miss Flashleigh's dark-eye shot its fieriest glance,<br />
  As young Spoonington span her along in the dance.<br />
  Even old Judge Sneerwell was heard to confess<br />
  That the Parsee's Ball was a perfect success.<br />
  And sweet Alice Grey was heard to sigh,<br />
  As she sped in the arms of her lover by,<br />
  &mdash;"O George, how pleasant!  I wish you could be,<br />
  To give such nice Balls, a wealthy Parsee!"<br />
  Ah little they knew what was coming to pass<br />
  Just that very moment to Funnydass!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For never before had Rummybhoy<br />
  Been so puffed up with pride, so elated with joy.<br />
  Grin after grin on his features glow'd:<br />
  Hither and thither he bustled and strode:<br />
  Dressed in his best, with bran new things on,<br />
  And the largest of all his diamond rings on.<br />
  Then off he went to the Public Hall<br />
  To see for himself the Jollipore Ball.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first to the Supper-Room went the Parsee,<br />
  From whence, through the half-open door, he could see<br />
  The ladies fleetly and faerily pass,&mdash;<br />
  (What nautch-girls they'd make, thought Funnydass!)<br />
  A cluster of gentlemen stood near the door,<br />
  Round Rice the Collector of Jollipore:&mdash;<br />
  Said Colonel McDreepweel, "Rice, ma boy,<br />
  Wha's this canny body&mdash;'this What's-his-name-bhoy?<br />
  He's gin us a varra successfu' hop!<br />
  Is it true the auld nigger keeps a wee shop?"<br />
  The Parsee listened.  His heart leapt high<br />
  With exultation and ecstasy.<br />
  Round the room he had entered he glanced with pride,<br />
  At the viands and wines he himself had supplied.<br />
  Then took a decanter that stood hard by,<br />
  Put its neck to his lips, and drained it dry.<br />
  Then thereby with sudden decision embued,<br />
  And fast grown elated (in other words, screwed,)<br />
  Took another small peg&mdash;deck'd his face with a grin&mdash;<br />
  Peep'd once more through the door&mdash;then straight stalk'd in.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grim Major Cruncher, tall Captain Fusee,<br />
  Were 'Stewards' that night, and spied the Parsee.<br />
  They strode up and said to him gruffly, "Hullo!<br />
  Who the deuce, pray, are you?  We don't want you here!  Go!"<br />
  To which the Parsee, determined to stick up<br />
  For his rights, replied with a dignified hiccup,&mdash;<br />
  "I gave dis Ball, sare, I've come (<i>hic</i>) to see<br />
  B'ut'ful Ladies, bare necks, (<i>hic</i>) white arms!&mdash;<i>He, he!</i><br />
  Dance up, dance down, go round, (<i>hic</i>) much charms,<br />
  Clasp'd very tight&mdash;like this&mdash;in Sahib's arms!"<br />
  &mdash;Hereat with a giggle the merry Parsee<br />
  Put his arms round the waist of th' astonish'd Fusee!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need I say, in a trice, they half-pushed, half-bore<br />
  The struggling Rummybhoy back through the door?<br />
  He roar'd as loud as his lungs were able,<br />
  He tried to clutch hold of the supper-table,<br />
  Kick'd, gnashed his teeth, swore, pull'd Cruncher's hair,<br />
  And fell, with poor Fusee, over a chair.<br />
  Then while as yet he was down on all fours,<br />
  He was dragg'd by the Major, heels-up, out of doors.<br />
  Then spake fierce Cruncher to fiery Fusee,<br />
  "Let's teach him a lesson&mdash;let's duck the Parsee!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars were bright: 'twas a lovely night:<br />
  In the tamarind glitter'd the firefly's light.<br />
  Not a cloudlet went through the firmament,<br />
  From whence the moon her sweet face bent.<br />
  Not a sound the balmy stillness broke,<br />
  Save a frog's luxurious, languid croak&mdash;<br />
  A frog that sat in his moist mud-hole<br />
  And in music gave vent to the joy in his soul!<br />
  And strange to relate (so mysterious is fate)<br />
  'Twas doom'd that the Parsee's luckless pate,<br />
  In that very site, that very night,<br />
  Should fearfully, suddenly, swiftly alight!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've said the sweet moon looked down from the sky.&mdash;<br />
  She revealed a tank that rippled hard by.<br />
  Rushes and weeds grew round its brim,<br />
  'Twas a pretty place for a midnight swim!<br />
  <i>Neems</i> and <i>Portias</i> grew on its bank,<br />
  That rose some eight feet over the tank.<br />
  Now hither, to this embankment's top,<br />
  His captors dragg'd Rummybhoy, neck and crop.<br />
  "Heave-yo!" cried Cruncher.  A splash, and a thud!<br />
  And the Parsee splutter'd in water and mud!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of Hindoos had gathered around.<br />
  They saw to the Parsee's not being drown'd.<br />
  He soberly homewards then quietly stole,<br />
  Steady of foot, and heavy of soul.<br />
  Resolved, as long as he chanced to live,<br />
  Never again a GRAND BALL, to give.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough, O my readers.  'Tis not my intention,<br />
  To give you a MORAL.  I'll only mention,<br />
  That, as hours roll'd by, and the dances were done,<br />
  And the dancers drove homewards one by one,<br />
  That each to the other, and one and all,<br />
  Declared it '<i>a most successful Ball!</i>'<br />

  Redder than my scarlet facings rose the blush upon her cheek,<br />
  When I took her hand, and, kneeling, cleared my choking throat to speak.<br />
  "Alice!" said I, "Pearl of Women," (heedless of her sudden frown)<br />
  "Alice, ducky-darling, hear me, hear your own devoted Brown!"<br />
  "Sir," she answer'd, "Say no more please, I,&mdash;<i>hem</i>,&mdash;only yesterday,<br />

  Blood and thunder, fire and furies!  From my knees I leapt in wrath,<br />
  Knock'd my shins against a foot-stool, crushed a kitten in my path.<br />
  Leapt into the saddle wildly, madly homewards dashed away,<br />
  Gnash'd my teeth and swore at Jenkins of the Revenue Survey.<br />

  I will rear a score of children, teach them to be true Hindoos,<br />

  This remedy is simple, empyric, and complete,&mdash;<br />
  One pint of brandy hourly, and taken almost neat."<br />

  Then with a final stagger, falls down, and snores away.<br />
  Not till the following morning, when high has climb'd the sun,<br />
  Is his slumber broken, or his snoring done.<br />
  The poison then is conquer'd.  But it often leaves behind<br />
  A thirstiness, a head-ache, a depression of the mind.<br />
  But this to cure is easy.  The head-ache quickly flies<br />
  If the patient round his forehead a well-wet towel ties.<br />

  Once lived in this city.  He lives there now.<br />
  A man whose success in life was complete;<br />
  He had the best house in the very best street.<br />
  He throve well on ghee; he was worth, I am told,<br />
  A couple of lacs in lands and gold.<br />
  His youngest wife, sweet Betelammâl,<br />
  Was rich, and fair, and, for thirteen, tall.<br />
  As his morals were so-so, but rigid his creed,<br />
  Men thought him a very good Brahmin indeed.<br />
  He said long <i>Mantras</i>; he strictly kept caste:<br />
  Each pariah slunk from the road till he passed.<br />
  Nothing was strange about his person;&mdash;<br />
  You might see a better, you might see a worse one.<br />
  In short, our Rowdy was happy, and bore<br />
  A very good name in Brahminipore.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Ichabod Green, a Quaker, one day<br />
  Happened to travel along that way.<br />
  A harmless soul, with a fat little frame,<br />
  Along the street he leisurely came.<br />
  At the very first glance could be easily seen<br />
  What sort of person was Mr. Green.<br />
  In his mild, meek eyes his heart you could trace,<br />
  And PEACH was writ on his placid face.<br />
  On he sauntered, not thinking his feet<br />
  Would defile the mud of that sacred street,<br />
  A street that seemed public to beast and to man,<br />
  For right along it the highway ran.<br />
  So on he came, and came at last<br />
  To Rowdy Row's house, and would have passed;<br />
  But the holy Brahmin rushed forth with a shout,<br />
  "You white cow-eater, get out, get out!<br />
  Go back!  Quick!  Run!  your low caste feet<br />
  Will defile the mud of this sacred street!"<br />
  But since poor Green, with a startled stare,<br />
  Said; "Sir, I thought this a thoroughfare,"<br />
  The righteous Brahmin gave him a kick,<br />
  And knocked him about the head with a stick.<br />
  Then while his applauding friends drew round,<br />
  He kicked him again as he lay on the ground.<br />
  He gave him a whack, he gave him a crack,<br />
  He smack'd his face, and sat on his back.<br />
  He thump'd him, he bump'd him, he tugged at his hair,<br />
  He tumbled him here, he pummelled him there.<br />
  He used his slipper, he used his fist,<br />
  Gave a tweak to his nose, to his ear a twist;<br />
  He laughed as he heard poor Ichabod's cries,<br />
  And filled with sand poor Ichabod's eyes.<br />
  Then set him again on his tottering feet,<br />
  And hooted him out of the sacred street.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a moan, with many a groan,<br />
  Poor Ichabod trudged on his way alone.<br />
  For his servants, when they beheld the fray,<br />
  Had one and all skedaddled away.<br />
  That night on the road poor Ichabod spent;<br />
  Next day to the Dewan Peischar went;<br />
  Stated his case,&mdash;where, when, and how,<br />
  He had got such a thrashing from Rowdy Row:<br />
  And showed, as witness, his tattered clothes,<br />
  His blackened eyes and his damaged nose.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the Peishcar, with solemn face,<br />
  Had gone right through this remarkable case,<br />
  To his chief, the Dewan, for sentence due<br />
  He sent Mr. Green, and Rowdy too.<br />
  Sir Gammon Row, with his grandest bow,<br />
  Received Mr. Green and Rowdy Row.<br />
  Mr. Green had a chair,&mdash;but I really think<br />
  He gave friend Rowdy a nod and a wink.<br />
  Then he read through the case; and as he read<br />
  Adjusted the turban upon his head:<br />
  Now turned his eyes up, now turned his eyes down,<br />
  Now smiled a sweet smile, now frown'd a stern frown:<br />
  Now sighed; now his head sagaciously shook;&mdash;<br />
  And look'd&mdash;in short&mdash;as wise as a book.<br />
  Then, after many a <i>hum</i> and <i>haw</i><br />
  Summ'd up,&mdash;and thus declared the law.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, Mr. Green, were very wrong<br />
  In daring that street to venture along.<br />
  You ought to have known that your low-caste feet<br />
  Would defile the mud of that sacred street.<br />
  As a "<i>neecha jâthi káran</i>" you<br />
  Should render the Brahmins reverence due.<br />
  For all know that Brahmins, in every place,<br />
  Are a quiet, peaceful, respectable race,<br />
  Whilst Quakers&mdash;(Sir Gammon here heav'd a sigh,<br />
  And turned up the greenish white of his eye!)<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the second place, that street you declare<br />
  Was merely,&mdash;you thought,&mdash;a thoroughfare;<br />
  Since straight along it the highway ran,<br />
  Open to beast, and public to man.<br />
  You thought this, did you?  Who ever heard<br />
  Of a thought so palpably absurd!<br />
  Good Heavens, Mr. Green! a Brahmin street<br />
  Public to every Englishman's feet!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirdly, you thought it a <i>highway</i>?  Then can<br />
  You wonder they thought you a <i>highwayman</i>?<br />
  They acknowledge they gave you a thrashing.  Hence<br />
  I infer they did so&mdash;in self-defence!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fourthly, who authorised you, I pray<br />
  In daring to travel along that way?<br />
  'Twas a street of Brahmins, a sacred spot;<br />
  It might have been public, yet it might not.<br />
  You heeded this not: you prejudged the case;<br />
  And boldly ventured into the place;&mdash;<br />
  And frightened poor Rowdy, a mild Hindoo,<br />
  Into thrashing&mdash;yes, into half-killing&mdash;you,<br />
  which in him, since he thought he ought to use force,<br />
  Was somewhat excusable conduct of course.<br />
  So this is my final sentence&mdash;that he<br />
  Should pay the fine of <i>one Rupee</i>."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ended this wonderful case: and now<br />
  You may judge, my readers, of 'Good Gammon Row:'<br />
  &mdash;Oh hark to gay Rowdy's jeer and scoff,<br />
  At poor Green, as from Court he sadly moves off,<br />
  Moves off through an oily and turban'd crowd,<br />
  Of Brahmins that laugh in their triumph aloud.<br />
  &mdash;They shout "We may thrash these white men, for we<br />
  Shall be fined but lightly for such a grand spree."<br />
  It is good to laugh!  Say, is it not sport<br />
  To see such a glorious scene in a Court!&mdash;<br />
  Fair JUSTICE perverted, PUBLIC RIGHT<br />
  Shamed and insulted in all men's sight.<br />
  Ha, Ha!  Let us laugh!  To respect what claim<br />
  Has an Englishman's honour, an Englishman's name?<br />
  A MORAL let us, like a foolscap, draw<br />
  O'er the bald grand head of ancient Law:<br />
  It is this:&mdash;All truth, all justice is fudge<br />
  When a Brahmin is judged by a Brahmin Judge!<br />

<p class="poem">
  Three and twenty Aprils<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have fled since that April night,<br />
  When you and I were together<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All under the sweet star-light.<br />
  The fireflies flitted round us,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air was cool and calm;<br />
  We could see the broad moon rising,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the stems of a grove of palm.<br />
  The garden trees around us<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigh'd, as the wind swept by;<br />
  And the road-side casuarinas<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent back a softer sigh.<br />
  You stoop'd, and pick'd me a posy,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me, I have it yet!<br />
  'Twas a little rose-bud, circled<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sprigs of mignonette.<br />
  The dewy myrtles glistened,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my eyes&mdash;with other dew;<br />
  The trelliced jasmine trembled,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my heart in its love for you!<br />
  'Twas then, as the rising moonlight.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On your sweet face softly glow'd,&mdash;<br />
  'Twas then that the words of my passion,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears of my yearning flowed.<br />
  I think you liked me, Anna?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my pay was a little too low,<br />
  So "ask Papa," was your answer,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Which led to a final NO.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Anna, I know I've altered.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But do not you forget<br />
  That when I sought your favours<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were a young brunette:<br />
  Your form, through the ball-room flitting,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had an exquisite, infinite grace;<br />
  And your splendid tresses o'ershadow'd<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tender and eloquent face.<br />
  But now?  Ah Anna Maria,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it nothing for ladies to see<br />
  The dawn of an April morning<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which welcomes them forty-three?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I've grown much stouter&mdash;I know it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can't have fall'n off like you:&mdash;<br />
  Anna, do you know your complexion<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has taken a muddy hue?<br />
  I see that you paint and powder:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think padded dresses you wear?<br />
  And I know those luxurious ringlets,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plaits, are simply false hair!<br />
  That your hands are skinny, I notice;&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are shrivell'd under the rings.<br />
  Yes, and lately you told me, "low dresses<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are very indecent things!"<br />
  I quite understand you, Anna:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust you understand me?<br />
  Mayhap, love's blind at twenty,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He isn't at forty-three!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So it's no use now, I assure you,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sigh whenever we meet;<br />
  To beckon to me at the Bandstand,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ogle at me in the street;&mdash;<br />
  To seat you in Church close by me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by many a look and sign<br />
  To hint you've forgotten your prayer-book,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So would like to look over mine;&mdash;<br />
  To press my hand when you shake it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote my own verses to me;&mdash;<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamt I had a score!'<br />
  But him, too, you rejected<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A squalling and bawling,&mdash;<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it chanced to-day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we were returning<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of death and the tomb,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And demons and doom,<br />
  And the final universal burning,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That straight in front of our faces,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not distant three hundred paces,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw that sudden flare,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That roof in the air,<br />

  Had walked into our powder-magazine.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no&mdash;I assure you, no!<br />

  The explosion was <i>quite</i> in the usual way,&mdash;<br />
  A thing we've got used to long ago!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The occurrence was simple.  'Twas merely this.<br />
  A parcel arrived at the Post Office,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Banghy Parcel, marked, WITH CARE<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, bang it went!<br />

  Door, and window, and postmen, and all,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, and there, and everywhere!<br />

  &mdash;Well, well, my friends, I need hardly say<br />
  Explosions are blessings in their own way.<br />
  When one occurs, it is one of its tricks<br />

  The Death of the Rev. Melchizedec Jones.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  My readers will hear, with mournful groans,<br />
  Of the death of the Rev. Melchizedec Jones.<br />
  This gentleman, famed for learning and piety,<br />
  Belong'd to the Teetotal Mission Society,<br />
  And for the last twelve years, or more,<br />
  Laboured with zeal at Arrackpore.<br />
  I may also add that, with lonely moans,<br />
  Ten children mourn the defunct Mr. Jones:<br />
  Indeed their sorrow passes description,<br />
  And really demands a handsome subscription.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas half past six last Tuesday eve<br />
  When Mr. Jones of his Station took his leave.<br />
  He travelled per cart&mdash;his usual plan&mdash;<br />
  With a lantern-bearer and handyman.<br />
  As the road was smooth, and uncommonly sandy,<br />
  Mr. Jones fell fast asleep in his bandy.<br />
  The bandyman snoozed.  And alas! no stones<br />
  Gave a warning jolt to him or to Jones.<br />
  Now came the critical moment, in which<br />
  The lantern went out, as they near'd a ditch,&mdash;<br />
  A slushy, prodigious, hideous pit<br />
  With no end of black mud at the bottom of it!<br />
  (Over which a bridge, as might be expected,<br />
  The D. P. W. had <i>not</i> erected!)<br />
  A roll&mdash;then a rattle&mdash;then Jones cried out "stop!"<br />
  Then the bandy and bullocks went clean over&mdash;plop!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, I omitted to mention before<br />
  What sort of luggage the bandy bore,<br />
  How under his mattrass poor Jones had packed<br />
  Many a book and many a tract.<br />
  For Jones was wont, where'er he might go,<br />
  To be a sort of travelling Depôt.<br />
  There were pamphlets in English,&mdash;heap on heap,<br />
  Badly printed, but very cheap.<br />
  There were newspapers, too, for mild Hindoos<br />
  With everything in them, excepting news.<br />
  There were bundles and bundles, and layers and layers,<br />
  Of very wise sayings by very wise sayers.<br />
  Tracts in Canarese, tracts in Tamil,<br />
  Enough to have broken the back of a camel.<br />
  It would have been lucky for Jones that night<br />
  If only this literature had been <i>light</i>;<br />
  Or if only he had omitted to place<br />
  Under his pillow his travelling case.<br />
  For now his bandy, ah woe is me!<br />
  Had fallen with its roof where its wheels ought to be:<br />
  And thus it was not a very great wonder<br />
  That his luggage was up, and poor Jones was under.<br />
  Pray what could the Reverend gentleman do?<br />
  The deep black mud was as sticky as glue.<br />
  There was mud at his night-cap, and mud at his socks,<br />
  On his back were his books, on his head was his box.<br />
  In the ditch the bandyman struggled and splutter'd,<br />
  But not a word the poor gentleman utter'd:<br />
  But, imbedded in mud some three feet deep,<br />
  Calmly and quietly went to sleep.<br />
  The handyman then with care unpacked<br />
  Book and newspaper, pamphlet and tract;<br />
  And found&mdash;&mdash;if he could, he would have turned pale&mdash;<br />
  His good old master as dead as a nail!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So died Mr. Jones.  Oh! D. P. W.<br />
  Have you no conscience, or doesn't it trouble you?<br />
  Are your funds all expended, or do you not care<br />
  That the roads are shockingly bad everywhere?<br />
  Here on the stones we rattle our bones,<br />
  There meet with great pits, such as did for poor Jones.<br />
  Well, shall I say more?  Shall my verse repeat<br />
  Some truths which I know are too true to be sweet?<br />
  Your healths, good sirs,&mdash;R. E.'s and O. E.'s!<br />
  You are mighty hands at spending rupees!<br />
  You build fine bridges, you spend many a lac,<br />
  And for zeal and discretion get clapped on the back;<br />
  Till down roll the rivers in flood some day,<br />
  And sweep your gingerbread structures away.<br />
  Then come explanations.  It is easy, you know,<br />
  To say this, or that arch, was too narrow or low.<br />
  That a flaw was here, or a fault was there,<br />
  Or the mortar was somehow not mixed with care,<br />
  Or that some unaccountable swirl of the tide<br />
  Did this, when it should have done something beside.<br />
  Oh Sirs, you are wise!  But wondrous to say<br />
  Your wisdom comes always too late in the day.<br />
  Here in India, forsooth! our barracks must crumble,<br />
  Embankments give way, and light-houses tumble.<br />
  In another clime they have bridged the pride<br />
  Of ice-charg'd St. Lawrence's terrible tide!<br />
  They curb the sea in Holland, but here<br />
  A tank is too strong for our Engineer!<br />
  Then hail, merry gentlemen, R. and C. E.'s!<br />
  Spend on the generous Public's rupees!<br />
  May you ne'er meet some end, like that, by which<br />
  The light of Jones was snuff'd out in a ditch!<br />

  Dear Captain Green,&mdash;This morning, I see,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Gazette</i> good news for you bears:&mdash;<br />
  "<i>On leave for six months to proceed to sea<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  O happy Green, is she blonde or brunette?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has she golden or raven tresses?<br />
  But will walking on land suit the tail of your pet?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope she judiciously dresses!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Her name?  Is she young?  Of course she can speak?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she wear her long hair in curls?<br />
  I trust she has got no scales on her cheek?<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But very strange to say,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon that self-same day,<br />
  I met three sisters, Alice, Clare, and Nelly:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelly had golden hair,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice sang well, and Clare<br />
  Was a great hand at making guava jelly!<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound by this triple chain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew not, in my pain,<br />
  To which of these fair three to bend my knees:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When at a ball one night<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst on my raptured sight<br />
  Star-like, the charms of my serene Louise.<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, ah!  I must confess<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A boundless amorousness<br />
  Ingrain'd and rooted in my nature is;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl I cannot see<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But straight there wakes in me<br />
  Unutterable longing for a kiss!<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When last, Madras, in thee<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw sweet Rosalie,<br />
  With eyes so blue, so bright, and O! so merry,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I loved her,&mdash;till I met<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coy and pale Annette,<br />
  A sweet French rose that blooms in Pondicherry.<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Trichy next I came,<br />

  Blazed for a little, then was quench'd in tears<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For soon I learnt, enraged,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Agnes was engaged<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Maud my heart perplext,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Annie, Constance next,&mdash;<br />
  The last a widow, aged twenty-one?<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough for me to say<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That now, though I grow gray,<br />
  My heart's as warm and tender as of yore.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, though my love burns bright<br />

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
