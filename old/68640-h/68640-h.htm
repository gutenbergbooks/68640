PUBLISHERS' PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
Mr. R. C. Caldwell, the lamented author of these
humourous papers, was the eldest son of Dr. Caldwell,
the great Missionary Bishop of Tinnevelly.  He was
originally intended for the Ministry, and went through
a course of Theological study at St. Augustine's
College, Canterbury.  After passing out of College, he
returned to India and worked zealously and assiduously
in the Mission field in Trichinopoly and Tanjore.
For some reasons, perhaps known to himself alone,
Mr. Caldwell did not take Orders but elected to
become a journalist as being more congenial to his
tastes.  Mr. Caldwell was known in England as a
frequent contributor to the English Journals,&mdash;the
<i>London Daily News</i>, the <i>Athenæum</i>, the <i>Contemporary
Review</i>, the <i>Illustrated London News</i> and
even <i>Punch</i>.  Some Ballads and Songs he had then
written were set to music by one of the most popular
composers of the day and produced on the stage.
His "Chutney Lyrics"&mdash;some twelve of which were
originally contributed to the <i>Madras Athenæum and
Daily News</i>,&mdash;first prominently brought him to notice
in India.  On leaving the Mission Mr. Caldwell took
up for a short time the co-editorship of the <i>Madras
Times</i> and then transferred his services to the
<i>Athenæum and Daily News</i> of which he was for a
short period sole editor.  He conducted the latter
journal most successfully, but the general complaint
against him was too much personality in his writings.
His weekly "<i>Chit Chat</i>" gave offence to not a few,
though all willingly conceded that these papers
afforded much amusement and effected considerable
good in exposing many of the evils that then existed
in Madras.  Mr. Caldwell was subsequently employed
by the Newspaper press of the Bombay and Bengal
Presidencies and by the wit and humour of his
writings gained extensive popularity.  He died in
harness in April or May 1878.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We reproduce "Chutney Lyrics" with the eight
other comic pieces published in 1871 as their
popularity has not diminished and they are frequently
enquired for.  We trust that this present edition will
meet with a renewal of the favor so readily accorded
to the previous edition.

  Sir R-ch-rd T-mpl-'s Ghost.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was midnight dark and dreary;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sitting lone and weary,<br />
  And, on public projects brooding, my poor head was aching sore:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When into my chamber striding<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came a sable stranger gliding,<br />
  Then, without pretence at hiding, squatted on the matted floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatted calmly on the floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatted; grinned,&mdash;and nothing more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting up, I eyed the native<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an aspect legislative,<br />
  Saying sternly, "Off thou caitiff! know'st thou ME, vile blackamoor?"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the intruder, nought replying,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought asserting, nought denying,<br />
  Silent sat, my motions eyeing, chewing betel as before;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatting on the matted floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chewing, grinning,&mdash;nothing more!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wretch!" I cried, with wrath rampageous,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This your conduct's quite outrageous.<br />
  Get thee gone, or I will thump thee, thou audacious blackamoor!"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the stranger, nothing caring,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his daring ghostly bearing,<br />
  With his grinning, and his staring, madden'd me still more and more,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squatting on the matted floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chewing betel,&mdash;nothing more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there rose in me a terror,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought I, "Are my eyes in error?<br />
  It is surely some black phantom come from Dreamland's shadowy shore;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis a Ghoul, or Shape of evil,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lemure, Spectre, Imp, or Devil,<br />
  Wont to hold fantastic revel in the brain's distracted core:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing squats upon that floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis my fancy,&mdash;nothing more!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning then, the Shape unheeding,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight I sat me down to reading,<br />
  Reading Balance Sheets, whereover 'twas my duty then to pore:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But:&mdash;'twas strange&mdash;methought the figures<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took to dancing sudden jiggers,<br />
  Like a troupe of dancing niggers, whirling, twirling, more and more;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the phantom from the floor<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose and watched them,&mdash;nothing more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bogie!" said I, "You're right gracious!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you think me too audacious<br />
  If I ask you what your name is, since we've never met before?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you hail from hell or heaven?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know a certain raven<br />
  That appeared, like you, one even, to the Poet of Lenore?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me, Mr. Blackamoor,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me this, and nothing more!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grinning still, but still naught heeding,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood that silent Stranger reading,<br />
  Reading to himself the figures my Financial Statement bore.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fool!" I cried exasperated,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is your curious humour sated?<br />
  You will not seem so elated when I kick you through that door!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, or quit my matted floor!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's your business, blackamoor!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now, that spectre sable<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snatched <i>The Budget</i> from my table;<br />
  Through THE SURPLUS with his finger drew a broad phosphoric score,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, while steamed a sulph'rous vapour,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrote in phosphorus on the paper&mdash;<br />
  DEFICIT!&mdash;then with a caper, straight evanished through the floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished through the matted floor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breathing brimstone,&mdash;nothing more!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled and thrilled with trembling wonder,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forthwith, with a voice of thunder,<br />
  "Boy!" I cried, "Bring me some cognac!"&mdash;and the Boy some cognac bore:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, from me, I know that never<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits shall that Spirit sever,<br />
  Though adown my throat for ever, peg on peg I wildly pour.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still that phantom, o'er and o'er,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFICIT! writes evermore.<br />

  The Jollipore Ball<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  At Jollipore lived a sleek Parsee,&mdash;<br />
  RUNNYDASS, RUMMYBHOY, CURSETJEE.<br />
  With keeping the only shop of the Station,<br />
  He united a Sowcar's occupation.<br />
  A plump little man, with a waddling walk,<br />
  In mien most mild, most courteous in talk;<br />
  If you caught him cheating, you'd only smile,<br />
  He did it in <i>such</i> a pleasant style,&mdash;<br />
  As if he were only striving to please<br />
  By accepting from you a few rupees!<br />
  Ah not without meaning did Nature place<br />
  That keen little eye in that smooth sleek face,<br />
  That restless, inquisitive, hungry eye,<br />
  Which nothing could pass unscrutinized by!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone midst Hindoos, he lived like Hindoos,<br />
  Dressed in turband, and cloths, and light-yellow shoes,<br />
  Ruby and diamond rings gleamed on his hands:<br />
  He was rich in gold, and houses, and lands:<br />
  Massive chains on his person he wore,<br />
  And all knew his Phaeton in Jollipore.<br />
  When at evening he drove his pair of Pegus<br />
  He received low salaams from all the Hindoos;<br />
  And a nod from the Sahibs, as if to say,<br />
  'That's a good sort of fellow in his small way.'<br />
  Now Rummybhoy had his own aims in view<br />
  As stouter and sleeker and richer he grew.<br />
  "By Master's favour I'll rise," thought he,<br />
  "And be called by the Sahibs <i>the Model Parsee</i>.<br />
  And then&mdash;who knows&mdash;I may rise and rise,<br />
  And receive some tremendous, unlook'd for prize.<br />
  There's SIR SALAH JONG, there's SIR MADAVA ROW,<br />
  I dare say I'm richer than both of them now,<br />
  Then why should I not, too, rise to be<br />
  The great SIR RUMMYBHOY CURSETJEE?<br />
  Ha!&mdash;Good!&mdash;Let me think!&mdash;as the first step of all,<br />
  I'll give&mdash;yes&mdash;next week&mdash;a great GRAND BALL!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He announced his scheme.  To each gent in the station<br />
  He made a little verandah-oration.<br />
  To the Collector he said, "If Master please,<br />
  I will give for this Ball one thousand rupees."<br />
  A committee was formed of three or four<br />
  Of the leading gentry of Jollipore.<br />
  In their hands the Parsee entrusted all<br />
  The arrangements required for the forthcoming Ball,<br />
  They tasted the Champagne beforehand to see<br />
  It was real Simpkin, not gooseberry.<br />
  (Afterwards Rummybhoy used to say<br />
  Six dozens disappeared in this mild way!)<br />
  They issued the '<i>invites</i>.'  At length the night came<br />
  Which should inaugurate Rummybhoy's fame.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O what a rare sight was the "Public Hall"<br />
  On the night of the famous Jollipore Ball!<br />
  From above colour'd lamps their lustre flung;<br />
  And around gay flags and curtains were hung.<br />
  From the roof silk cloths, white, crimson, and gold,<br />
  Here tastefully droop'd in some elegant fold:<br />
  Whilst there some leafy device might be seen,<br />
  Whence grapes in cluster fell purple and green.<br />
  Each window'd recess of the Hall was a bower<br />
  Of pomegranates in fruit, and pomegranates in flower.<br />
  The doors were festoon'd with hollyhocks,<br />
  Rose, tuberose, myrtle, verbena, and phlox.<br />
  And creepers in flower, with tendrils of vine,<br />
  Around the pillars were taught to twine.<br />
  And now on the well-wax'd boarded floor<br />
  Throng'd the fair and the elite of Jollipore:<br />
  Twenty-six gentlemen, ladies eighteen,<br />
  Lent a life and a soul to the pleasant scene.<br />
  Merry music, fair forms in movement light,<br />
  And lovely faces aglow with delight.<br />
  There supporting the fragile Emily Moore<br />
  Whirl'd Snaffle, the pride of his cavalry corps.<br />
  Here Miss Flashleigh's dark-eye shot its fieriest glance,<br />
  As young Spoonington span her along in the dance.<br />
  Even old Judge Sneerwell was heard to confess<br />
  That the Parsee's Ball was a perfect success.<br />
  And sweet Alice Grey was heard to sigh,<br />
  As she sped in the arms of her lover by,<br />
  &mdash;"O George, how pleasant!  I wish you could be,<br />
  To give such nice Balls, a wealthy Parsee!"<br />
  Ah little they knew what was coming to pass<br />
  Just that very moment to Funnydass!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For never before had Rummybhoy<br />
  Been so puffed up with pride, so elated with joy.<br />
  Grin after grin on his features glow'd:<br />
  Hither and thither he bustled and strode:<br />
  Dressed in his best, with bran new things on,<br />
  And the largest of all his diamond rings on.<br />
  Then off he went to the Public Hall<br />
  To see for himself the Jollipore Ball.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first to the Supper-Room went the Parsee,<br />
  From whence, through the half-open door, he could see<br />
  The ladies fleetly and faerily pass,&mdash;<br />
  (What nautch-girls they'd make, thought Funnydass!)<br />
  A cluster of gentlemen stood near the door,<br />
  Round Rice the Collector of Jollipore:&mdash;<br />
  Said Colonel McDreepweel, "Rice, ma boy,<br />
  Wha's this canny body&mdash;'this What's-his-name-bhoy?<br />
  He's gin us a varra successfu' hop!<br />
  Is it true the auld nigger keeps a wee shop?"<br />
  The Parsee listened.  His heart leapt high<br />
  With exultation and ecstasy.<br />
  Round the room he had entered he glanced with pride,<br />
  At the viands and wines he himself had supplied.<br />
  Then took a decanter that stood hard by,<br />
  Put its neck to his lips, and drained it dry.<br />
  Then thereby with sudden decision embued,<br />
  And fast grown elated (in other words, screwed,)<br />
  Took another small peg&mdash;deck'd his face with a grin&mdash;<br />
  Peep'd once more through the door&mdash;then straight stalk'd in.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grim Major Cruncher, tall Captain Fusee,<br />
  Were 'Stewards' that night, and spied the Parsee.<br />
  They strode up and said to him gruffly, "Hullo!<br />
  Who the deuce, pray, are you?  We don't want you here!  Go!"<br />
  To which the Parsee, determined to stick up<br />
  For his rights, replied with a dignified hiccup,&mdash;<br />
  "I gave dis Ball, sare, I've come (<i>hic</i>) to see<br />
  B'ut'ful Ladies, bare necks, (<i>hic</i>) white arms!&mdash;<i>He, he!</i><br />
  Dance up, dance down, go round, (<i>hic</i>) much charms,<br />
  Clasp'd very tight&mdash;like this&mdash;in Sahib's arms!"<br />
  &mdash;Hereat with a giggle the merry Parsee<br />
  Put his arms round the waist of th' astonish'd Fusee!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need I say, in a trice, they half-pushed, half-bore<br />
  The struggling Rummybhoy back through the door?<br />
  He roar'd as loud as his lungs were able,<br />
  He tried to clutch hold of the supper-table,<br />
  Kick'd, gnashed his teeth, swore, pull'd Cruncher's hair,<br />
  And fell, with poor Fusee, over a chair.<br />
  Then while as yet he was down on all fours,<br />
  He was dragg'd by the Major, heels-up, out of doors.<br />
  Then spake fierce Cruncher to fiery Fusee,<br />
  "Let's teach him a lesson&mdash;let's duck the Parsee!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars were bright: 'twas a lovely night:<br />
  In the tamarind glitter'd the firefly's light.<br />
  Not a cloudlet went through the firmament,<br />
  From whence the moon her sweet face bent.<br />
  Not a sound the balmy stillness broke,<br />
  Save a frog's luxurious, languid croak&mdash;<br />
  A frog that sat in his moist mud-hole<br />
  And in music gave vent to the joy in his soul!<br />
  And strange to relate (so mysterious is fate)<br />
  'Twas doom'd that the Parsee's luckless pate,<br />
  In that very site, that very night,<br />
  Should fearfully, suddenly, swiftly alight!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've said the sweet moon looked down from the sky.&mdash;<br />
  She revealed a tank that rippled hard by.<br />
  Rushes and weeds grew round its brim,<br />
  'Twas a pretty place for a midnight swim!<br />
  <i>Neems</i> and <i>Portias</i> grew on its bank,<br />
  That rose some eight feet over the tank.<br />
  Now hither, to this embankment's top,<br />
  His captors dragg'd Rummybhoy, neck and crop.<br />
  "Heave-yo!" cried Cruncher.  A splash, and a thud!<br />
  And the Parsee splutter'd in water and mud!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of Hindoos had gathered around.<br />
  They saw to the Parsee's not being drown'd.<br />
  He soberly homewards then quietly stole,<br />
  Steady of foot, and heavy of soul.<br />
  Resolved, as long as he chanced to live,<br />
  Never again a GRAND BALL, to give.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough, O my readers.  'Tis not my intention,<br />
  To give you a MORAL.  I'll only mention,<br />
  That, as hours roll'd by, and the dances were done,<br />
  And the dancers drove homewards one by one,<br />
  That each to the other, and one and all,<br />
  Declared it '<i>a most successful Ball!</i>'<br />

  Boy!  The big tub from my bath-room, with a dozen chatties bring,<br />
  That, whilst seated in the water, o'er me may this punkah swing.<br />
  Pour the chatties gently o'er me; let me sit awhile in peace,<br />
  For one blissful hour forgetful, I am BROWN OF THE POLICE:&mdash;<br />
  Brown at whom Dacoits have trembled, Brown at whom the public looks<br />
  As the active Superintendent of a dozen great Taluqs&mdash;<br />
  Great Taluqs in which each morning some dread deed of murder's done,<br />
  And a score of arson cases flare before each rising sun!<br />
  But enough!  Why should I boast me?  Have not I this day been taught<br />
  That, to Woman's greater folly, all our greatness is as naught?<br />
  Foolish Woman!  Foolish Alice!&mdash;Ah, how can my tongue repeat<br />
  That one name, which is so bitter, yet was once so very sweet,&mdash;<br />
  Sweeter still than breath of lilies, yes than music sweeter yet,&mdash;<br />
  Sweet as when you read PROMOTED to your name in the Gazette!<br />
  Alice, Alice! thou hast scorned me, though I woo'd thee many a day,<br />
  Jilted me for that goose Jenkins of the Revenue Survey!<br />
  Yet I thought that I had won thee.  How I praised thy eyes, thy hair!<br />
  Told thee what the glass must tell thee,&mdash;false one, thou art very fair.<br />
  Curse thy beauty!  Brown the dauntless, Brown the dread of Wahabees,<br />
  To a woman, a weak woman, bent, in vain, his suppliant knees!<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I e'er forget this morning?  How my heart leapt in my breast<br />
  As I rode up to her compound, in full regimentals dressed:<br />
  Redder than my scarlet facings rose the blush upon her cheek,<br />
  When I took her hand, and, kneeling, cleared my choking throat to speak.<br />
  "Alice!" said I, "Pearl of Women," (heedless of her sudden frown)<br />
  "Alice, ducky-darling, hear me, hear your own devoted Brown!"<br />
  "Sir," she answer'd, "Say no more please, I,&mdash;<i>hem</i>,&mdash;only yesterday,<br />
  "Was engaged to Mr. Jenkins, of the Revenue Survey!"<br />
  Blood and thunder, fire and furies!  From my knees I leapt in wrath,<br />
  Knock'd my shins against a foot-stool, crushed a kitten in my path.<br />
  Leapt into the saddle wildly, madly homewards dashed away,<br />
  Gnash'd my teeth and swore at Jenkins of the Revenue Survey.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy, pour yet another chatty, for my head is getting hot,<br />
  Ha!  There's virtue in the coolness of the water in that pot!<br />
  Let the water trickle, trickle, dropping like a gracious rain<br />
  To revive the wither'd fancies of my poor love-blasted brain!<br />
  Love?  What word is this I utter!  Lips of Brown, that word eschew!<br />
  Leave it to the spluttering idiot, or barbarian Yahoo!<br />
  <i>Love?</i>  My watch-word shall be MURDER!  Every thug<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall hear my name.<br />
  Blackest niggers blanch with terror at the thunder of my fame.<br />
  Ho! each bloated Brahmin rascal, who my visage stern may see,<br />
  Trembling with a vague amazement, shall perspire great drops of ghee.<br />
  Yes! the Governor shall hear it, and my worth shall be confessed,<br />
  Till at length the Star of India blazes on my loyal breast.<br />
  Then, ah then, shall I take vengeance.  Foolish Alice, thou shalt own,&mdash;<br />
  Alice <i>Jenkins</i>,&mdash;what a treasure thou once lost in Captain <i>Brown</i>.<br />
  Terrible shall be my vengeance!  I will wed a pariah maid!<br />
  Future Browns shall yet wax browner, till at length in black they fade.<br />
  I will rear a score of children, teach them to be true Hindoos,<br />
  They shall worship cows or devils, or whatever they shall choose&mdash;<br />
  They shall chew the finest betel: on nice stale salt fish subsist,<br />
  And in their own bandies driving, learn their bullocks' tails to twist.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But enough!  I'm getting chilly.  There's a tickling in my nose.<br />

  Alice Jenkins, <i>tschi!</i> false Alice&mdash;there's a buzzing in my ear&mdash;<br />
  <i>Tschi!</i>  Confound it, in the water I have stay'd too long I fear.<br />
  Vengeance?  <i>Tschi!</i>  But why defer it?  Yes, I'll go this very day,<br />
  And smash the head of that goose Jenkins of the Revenue Survey!<br />

  Dr. Little's Grand Antidote for Snake-Bites

  Sapient Dr. Little to the public papers wrote,&mdash;<br />
  "At length, for bites of Cobras, I found an antidote.<br />
  On all my native servants this remedy I've tried,<br />
  And though they've oft been bitten, not one of them has died.<br />
  This remedy is simple, empyric, and complete,&mdash;<br />
  One pint of brandy hourly, and taken almost neat."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thus wrote Dr. Little.  But his letter had<br />
  Been perfect, had he added, the Post Scripts that I add.&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Such treatment is effective.  A drowsiness sets in:<br />
  O'er the features of the patient there spreads a languid grin.<br />
  With low and gentle hiccups, he croones an Indian lay,<br />
  Then with a final stagger, falls down, and snores away.<br />
  Not till the following morning, when high has climb'd the sun,<br />
  Is his slumber broken, or his snoring done.<br />
  The poison then is conquer'd.  But it often leaves behind<br />
  A thirstiness, a head-ache, a depression of the mind.<br />
  But this to cure is easy.  The head-ache quickly flies<br />
  If the patient round his forehead a well-wet towel ties.<br />
  His mind's prostration likewise, likewise his thirstiness,<br />
  Are quickly counteracted by a dose of B. and S."<br />

<p class="poem">
  (<i>Post Script, No. II.</i>) "But very strange to say<br />

  O who has not heard of that wonderful man,<br />
  SIR GAMMON ROW, the great Dewan,<br />
  Who has ruled for the last ten years, or more,<br />
  The Protected State of Cocoanutcore?<br />
  This State, if judged from "Reports" you read,<br />
  Is a very wonderful State indeed;&mdash;<br />
  A "<i>Model State</i>," in which you may see<br />
  Every thing is just as it should be.<br />
  Where dwells a worthy and well-oil'd nation,<br />
  Blest with a faultless administration;<br />
  The brightest land, with the lightest tax,<br />
  And an annual surplus of fifty lacs:<br />
  Where happy ryots, ne'er pester'd by famines,<br />
  Till fields, in subjection to blessed Brahmins.<br />
  A land of peace, a land of delight,<br />
  Where everyone, everywhere, always does right.<br />
  Where whitemen, living in meek minority,<br />
  Acknowledge Brahminical superiority.<br />
  In short, and I'm sure I cannot say more,<br />
  'Tis a heaven upon earth, this Cocoanutcore!<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this terrestrial elysium, the man<br />
  Who is most like an angel, is the Dewan.<br />
  From Comorin's foam to Himmaleh's snows,<br />
  A man that's his match, sure nobody knows!<br />
  In his gay free mien, and his honied laugh,<br />
  He is perfect,&mdash;yes almost too perfect by half!<br />
  How courtly his bow, his smile how sweet,<br />
  And how soft is the tread of his cat-like feet!<br />
  Then how frank his look! you might think you could view<br />
  The soul through the eye of this good Hindoo.<br />
  How chaste his manners, his English how choice!<br />
  How liquid, how mellow, the tones of his voice!<br />
  His whole demeanour seems to import<br />
  That <i>doing good</i> is his one great forte.<br />
  But since 'tis beyond the powers of my pen<br />
  To pourtray, as I should, this most perfect of men,<br />
  I'll relate, instead, a remarkable story<br />
  Which will picture Sir Gammon in all his glory,<br />
  His goodness, the justice he loves, and the claim<br />
  His deeds have to noto&mdash;I mean, to fame!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the country of Cocoanutcore<br />
  Lies the Brahmin city of Brahminipore.<br />
  Though you search'd through India up and down,<br />
  You could never discover a holier town.<br />
  For the blessed Twice-born, who chance to live there,<br />
  By deigning to breathe it, have hallowed the air&mdash;<br />
  The houses are holy, and holy each street,<br />
  And even the dust has been blessed by their feet.<br />
  Each pot in each hut, of brass or of clay,<br />
  Has been sanctified in some wonderful way.<br />
  And the sacred carpets in every house<br />
  Are the daily gift of Brahminical cows!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blessed brahmin, named Rowdy Row,<br />
  Once lived in this city.  He lives there now.<br />
  A man whose success in life was complete;<br />
  He had the best house in the very best street.<br />
  He throve well on ghee; he was worth, I am told,<br />
  A couple of lacs in lands and gold.<br />
  His youngest wife, sweet Betelammâl,<br />
  Was rich, and fair, and, for thirteen, tall.<br />
  As his morals were so-so, but rigid his creed,<br />
  Men thought him a very good Brahmin indeed.<br />
  He said long <i>Mantras</i>; he strictly kept caste:<br />
  Each pariah slunk from the road till he passed.<br />
  Nothing was strange about his person;&mdash;<br />
  You might see a better, you might see a worse one.<br />
  In short, our Rowdy was happy, and bore<br />
  A very good name in Brahminipore.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Ichabod Green, a Quaker, one day<br />

  At the very first glance could be easily seen<br />
  What sort of person was Mr. Green.<br />
  In his mild, meek eyes his heart you could trace,<br />
  And PEACH was writ on his placid face.<br />
  On he sauntered, not thinking his feet<br />
  Would defile the mud of that sacred street,<br />
  A street that seemed public to beast and to man,<br />
  For right along it the highway ran.<br />
  So on he came, and came at last<br />
  To Rowdy Row's house, and would have passed;<br />
  But the holy Brahmin rushed forth with a shout,<br />
  "You white cow-eater, get out, get out!<br />
  Go back!  Quick!  Run!  your low caste feet<br />
  Will defile the mud of this sacred street!"<br />
  But since poor Green, with a startled stare,<br />
  Said; "Sir, I thought this a thoroughfare,"<br />
  The righteous Brahmin gave him a kick,<br />
  And knocked him about the head with a stick.<br />
  Then while his applauding friends drew round,<br />
  He kicked him again as he lay on the ground.<br />
  He gave him a whack, he gave him a crack,<br />
  He smack'd his face, and sat on his back.<br />
  He thump'd him, he bump'd him, he tugged at his hair,<br />
  He tumbled him here, he pummelled him there.<br />
  He used his slipper, he used his fist,<br />
  Gave a tweak to his nose, to his ear a twist;<br />
  He laughed as he heard poor Ichabod's cries,<br />
  And filled with sand poor Ichabod's eyes.<br />
  Then set him again on his tottering feet,<br />
  And hooted him out of the sacred street.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a moan, with many a groan,<br />
  Poor Ichabod trudged on his way alone.<br />
  For his servants, when they beheld the fray,<br />
  Had one and all skedaddled away.<br />
  That night on the road poor Ichabod spent;<br />
  Next day to the Dewan Peischar went;<br />
  Stated his case,&mdash;where, when, and how,<br />
  He had got such a thrashing from Rowdy Row:<br />
  And showed, as witness, his tattered clothes,<br />
  His blackened eyes and his damaged nose.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the Peishcar, with solemn face,<br />
  Had gone right through this remarkable case,<br />
  To his chief, the Dewan, for sentence due<br />
  He sent Mr. Green, and Rowdy too.<br />
  Sir Gammon Row, with his grandest bow,<br />
  Received Mr. Green and Rowdy Row.<br />
  Mr. Green had a chair,&mdash;but I really think<br />
  He gave friend Rowdy a nod and a wink.<br />
  Then he read through the case; and as he read<br />
  Adjusted the turban upon his head:<br />
  Now turned his eyes up, now turned his eyes down,<br />
  Now smiled a sweet smile, now frown'd a stern frown:<br />
  Now sighed; now his head sagaciously shook;&mdash;<br />
  And look'd&mdash;in short&mdash;as wise as a book.<br />
  Then, after many a <i>hum</i> and <i>haw</i><br />
  Summ'd up,&mdash;and thus declared the law.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, Mr. Green, were very wrong<br />
  In daring that street to venture along.<br />
  You ought to have known that your low-caste feet<br />
  Would defile the mud of that sacred street.<br />
  As a "<i>neecha jâthi káran</i>" you<br />
  Should render the Brahmins reverence due.<br />
  For all know that Brahmins, in every place,<br />
  Are a quiet, peaceful, respectable race,<br />
  Whilst Quakers&mdash;(Sir Gammon here heav'd a sigh,<br />
  And turned up the greenish white of his eye!)<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the second place, that street you declare<br />
  Was merely,&mdash;you thought,&mdash;a thoroughfare;<br />
  Since straight along it the highway ran,<br />
  Open to beast, and public to man.<br />
  You thought this, did you?  Who ever heard<br />
  Of a thought so palpably absurd!<br />
  Good Heavens, Mr. Green! a Brahmin street<br />
  Public to every Englishman's feet!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirdly, you thought it a <i>highway</i>?  Then can<br />
  You wonder they thought you a <i>highwayman</i>?<br />
  They acknowledge they gave you a thrashing.  Hence<br />
  I infer they did so&mdash;in self-defence!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fourthly, who authorised you, I pray<br />
  In daring to travel along that way?<br />
  'Twas a street of Brahmins, a sacred spot;<br />
  It might have been public, yet it might not.<br />
  You heeded this not: you prejudged the case;<br />
  And boldly ventured into the place;&mdash;<br />
  And frightened poor Rowdy, a mild Hindoo,<br />
  Into thrashing&mdash;yes, into half-killing&mdash;you,<br />
  which in him, since he thought he ought to use force,<br />
  Was somewhat excusable conduct of course.<br />
  So this is my final sentence&mdash;that he<br />
  Should pay the fine of <i>one Rupee</i>."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus ended this wonderful case: and now<br />
  You may judge, my readers, of 'Good Gammon Row:'<br />
  &mdash;Oh hark to gay Rowdy's jeer and scoff,<br />
  At poor Green, as from Court he sadly moves off,<br />
  Moves off through an oily and turban'd crowd,<br />
  Of Brahmins that laugh in their triumph aloud.<br />
  &mdash;They shout "We may thrash these white men, for we<br />
  Shall be fined but lightly for such a grand spree."<br />
  It is good to laugh!  Say, is it not sport<br />
  To see such a glorious scene in a Court!&mdash;<br />
  Fair JUSTICE perverted, PUBLIC RIGHT<br />
  Shamed and insulted in all men's sight.<br />
  Ha, Ha!  Let us laugh!  To respect what claim<br />
  Has an Englishman's honour, an Englishman's name?<br />
  A MORAL let us, like a foolscap, draw<br />
  O'er the bald grand head of ancient Law:<br />
  It is this:&mdash;All truth, all justice is fudge<br />
  When a Brahmin is judged by a Brahmin Judge!<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't set your cap at me,<br />
  For do I not know your age is<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely forty-three?<br />
  For when I was twenty, Anna,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you were twenty, too.<br />
  Do you think I didn't find that out<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proposed to you?<br />
  Go to your mirror, Anna,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shake those false curls, and say&mdash;<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is faded indeed away!'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Three and twenty Aprils<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have fled since that April night,<br />
  When you and I were together<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All under the sweet star-light.<br />
  The fireflies flitted round us,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air was cool and calm;<br />
  We could see the broad moon rising,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the stems of a grove of palm.<br />
  The garden trees around us<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigh'd, as the wind swept by;<br />
  And the road-side casuarinas<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent back a softer sigh.<br />
  You stoop'd, and pick'd me a posy,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me, I have it yet!<br />
  'Twas a little rose-bud, circled<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sprigs of mignonette.<br />
  The dewy myrtles glistened,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my eyes&mdash;with other dew;<br />
  The trelliced jasmine trembled,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my heart in its love for you!<br />
  'Twas then, as the rising moonlight.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On your sweet face softly glow'd,&mdash;<br />
  'Twas then that the words of my passion,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears of my yearning flowed.<br />
  I think you liked me, Anna?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my pay was a little too low,<br />
  So "ask Papa," was your answer,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Which led to a final NO.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Anna, I know I've altered.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But do not you forget<br />
  That when I sought your favours<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were a young brunette:<br />
  Your form, through the ball-room flitting,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had an exquisite, infinite grace;<br />
  And your splendid tresses o'ershadow'd<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tender and eloquent face.<br />
  But now?  Ah Anna Maria,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it nothing for ladies to see<br />
  The dawn of an April morning<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which welcomes them forty-three?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I've grown much stouter&mdash;I know it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can't have fall'n off like you:&mdash;<br />
  Anna, do you know your complexion<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has taken a muddy hue?<br />
  I see that you paint and powder:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think padded dresses you wear?<br />
  And I know those luxurious ringlets,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plaits, are simply false hair!<br />
  That your hands are skinny, I notice;&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are shrivell'd under the rings.<br />
  Yes, and lately you told me, "low dresses<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are very indecent things!"<br />
  I quite understand you, Anna:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust you understand me?<br />
  Mayhap, love's blind at twenty,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He isn't at forty-three!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So it's no use now, I assure you,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sigh whenever we meet;<br />
  To beckon to me at the Bandstand,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ogle at me in the street;&mdash;<br />
  To seat you in Church close by me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by many a look and sign<br />
  To hint you've forgotten your prayer-book,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So would like to look over mine;&mdash;<br />
  To press my hand when you shake it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote my own verses to me;&mdash;<br />
  Heavens!  Anna, my dear, do remember<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are both of us forty-three!<br />

<p class="poem">
  I know you've had your offers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days that are no more;<br />
  There was SWELLINGTON at Trichy,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was CRABBE at Bangalore:<br />
  But CRABBE was old and crusty,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And SWELLINGTON, you knew,<br />
  Was deep in debt, and wanted<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your money, and not you.<br />
  Next D. P. W. HARDUP,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next SWIG, with the D. T.<br />
  Next wild JACK HARE, the Planter,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then miserable ME.<br />
  And then your love's soft witchery<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old COLONEL LIVER caged,&mdash;<br />
  But when engaged to marry<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stern death his thoughts engaged!<br />
  The next and last proposal<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came from a reverend gent,<br />
  When grave ARCHDEACON TRIPLET<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before your beauty bent.<br />
  'Take me,' he sigh'd, 'ten cherubs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My former help-meet bore,&mdash;<br />
  And three times running, lately<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamt I had a score!'<br />
  But him, too, you rejected<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scorn'd his pious flame,<br />
  And sent the startled suitor<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back, quicker than he came.<br />
  And now&mdash;Ah Anna, Anna,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You strive again to hook<br />
  This little worthless minnow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You flung back into the brook!<br />

  I walk in my garden, Anna;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lilies glisten with dew:<br />
  My heart grows softer towards you;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a tear in my eye for you.<br />
  I am thinking, sadly thinking,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that night, so long ago;<br />
  Of the living hopes that were mine, dear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere slain by that felon NO.<br />
  I am dreaming, sadly dreaming,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had we been married, Ann,<br />
  Would not <i>you</i>'ve been a better woman,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <i>I</i> a better man?<br />
  God knows, but that something to pray for&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children about the knees&mdash;<br />
  Might have made you think less of dresses,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made me think less of rupees;<br />
  That something to work for, to hope for,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, and to <i>weep</i> for, too,<br />
  Might have made me of self less careless,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have raised and strengthen'd you.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Enough!  These are moonlight fancies:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality&mdash;look at that!<br />
  You are old and thin, dear Anna,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am old and fat.<br />
  Can birds build nests in winter?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or make honey, in winter, the bee?<br />
  Come then&mdash;don't ogle.  Remember<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are both of us forty-three!<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd have certainly been<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a pretty fright,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have thought, I ween,<br />
  As you saw the flash and heard the report,<br />
  That someone, who had his cigar alight,<br />
  Had walked into our powder-magazine.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no&mdash;I assure you, no!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas nothing of the sort!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I say,<br />
  The explosion was <i>quite</i> in the usual way,&mdash;<br />
  A thing we've got used to long ago!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The occurrence was simple.  'Twas merely this.<br />
  A parcel arrived at the Post Office,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Banghy Parcel, marked, WITH CARE<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In our Indian slang<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Banghy</i> means, <i>It is apt to bang!</i>)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, bang it went!<br />
  And sent the Post Office, roof and wall,<br />
  Door, and window, and postmen, and all,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, and there, and everywhere!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas a "bearing parcel:" it bore some<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the very finest Petroleum,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sample sent<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For experiment<br />
  By a Firm to a scientific gent.<br />
  &mdash;Well, well, my friends, I need hardly say<br />
  Explosions are blessings in their own way.<br />
  When one occurs, it is one of its tricks<br />
  To knock a few postmen up with the bricks,<br />
  Thus, in the Postal Service, you know,<br />
  Promotion is never very slow:<br />
  Some get promoted to heavenly bliss,<br />
  And some, on earth, in the Post Office.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;And then,<br />
  Over the graves of the dead postmen,<br />
  Consider what epitaphs one might pen!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might write o'er the stone&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Reader, who passest by,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Postman's body that lies below,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drop not a tear, nor sigh,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor sob, nor moan,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his soul did go, from this world or woe,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Banghy-post, straight to the sky!"<br />

<a id="death"></a>
  The Death of the Rev. Melchizedec Jones.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  My readers will hear, with mournful groans,<br />
  Of the death of the Rev. Melchizedec Jones.<br />
  This gentleman, famed for learning and piety,<br />
  Belong'd to the Teetotal Mission Society,<br />
  And for the last twelve years, or more,<br />
  Laboured with zeal at Arrackpore.<br />
  I may also add that, with lonely moans,<br />
  Ten children mourn the defunct Mr. Jones:<br />
  Indeed their sorrow passes description,<br />
  And really demands a handsome subscription.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas half past six last Tuesday eve<br />
  When Mr. Jones of his Station took his leave.<br />
  He travelled per cart&mdash;his usual plan&mdash;<br />
  With a lantern-bearer and handyman.<br />
  As the road was smooth, and uncommonly sandy,<br />
  Mr. Jones fell fast asleep in his bandy.<br />
  The bandyman snoozed.  And alas! no stones<br />
  Gave a warning jolt to him or to Jones.<br />
  Now came the critical moment, in which<br />
  The lantern went out, as they near'd a ditch,&mdash;<br />
  A slushy, prodigious, hideous pit<br />
  With no end of black mud at the bottom of it!<br />
  (Over which a bridge, as might be expected,<br />
  The D. P. W. had <i>not</i> erected!)<br />
  A roll&mdash;then a rattle&mdash;then Jones cried out "stop!"<br />
  Then the bandy and bullocks went clean over&mdash;plop!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, I omitted to mention before<br />
  What sort of luggage the bandy bore,<br />
  How under his mattrass poor Jones had packed<br />
  Many a book and many a tract.<br />
  For Jones was wont, where'er he might go,<br />
  To be a sort of travelling Depôt.<br />
  There were pamphlets in English,&mdash;heap on heap,<br />
  Badly printed, but very cheap.<br />
  There were newspapers, too, for mild Hindoos<br />
  With everything in them, excepting news.<br />
  There were bundles and bundles, and layers and layers,<br />
  Of very wise sayings by very wise sayers.<br />
  Tracts in Canarese, tracts in Tamil,<br />
  Enough to have broken the back of a camel.<br />
  It would have been lucky for Jones that night<br />
  If only this literature had been <i>light</i>;<br />
  Or if only he had omitted to place<br />
  Under his pillow his travelling case.<br />
  For now his bandy, ah woe is me!<br />
  Had fallen with its roof where its wheels ought to be:<br />
  And thus it was not a very great wonder<br />
  That his luggage was up, and poor Jones was under.<br />
  Pray what could the Reverend gentleman do?<br />
  The deep black mud was as sticky as glue.<br />
  There was mud at his night-cap, and mud at his socks,<br />
  On his back were his books, on his head was his box.<br />
  In the ditch the bandyman struggled and splutter'd,<br />
  But not a word the poor gentleman utter'd:<br />
  But, imbedded in mud some three feet deep,<br />
  Calmly and quietly went to sleep.<br />
  The handyman then with care unpacked<br />
  Book and newspaper, pamphlet and tract;<br />
  And found&mdash;&mdash;if he could, he would have turned pale&mdash;<br />
  His good old master as dead as a nail!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So died Mr. Jones.  Oh! D. P. W.<br />
  Have you no conscience, or doesn't it trouble you?<br />
  Are your funds all expended, or do you not care<br />
  That the roads are shockingly bad everywhere?<br />
  Here on the stones we rattle our bones,<br />
  There meet with great pits, such as did for poor Jones.<br />
  Well, shall I say more?  Shall my verse repeat<br />
  Some truths which I know are too true to be sweet?<br />
  Your healths, good sirs,&mdash;R. E.'s and O. E.'s!<br />
  You are mighty hands at spending rupees!<br />
  You build fine bridges, you spend many a lac,<br />
  And for zeal and discretion get clapped on the back;<br />
  Till down roll the rivers in flood some day,<br />
  And sweep your gingerbread structures away.<br />
  Then come explanations.  It is easy, you know,<br />
  To say this, or that arch, was too narrow or low.<br />
  That a flaw was here, or a fault was there,<br />
  Or the mortar was somehow not mixed with care,<br />
  Or that some unaccountable swirl of the tide<br />
  Did this, when it should have done something beside.<br />
  Oh Sirs, you are wise!  But wondrous to say<br />
  Your wisdom comes always too late in the day.<br />
  Here in India, forsooth! our barracks must crumble,<br />
  Embankments give way, and light-houses tumble.<br />
  In another clime they have bridged the pride<br />
  Of ice-charg'd St. Lawrence's terrible tide!<br />
  They curb the sea in Holland, but here<br />
  A tank is too strong for our Engineer!<br />
  Then hail, merry gentlemen, R. and C. E.'s!<br />
  Spend on the generous Public's rupees!<br />
  May you ne'er meet some end, like that, by which<br />
  The light of Jones was snuff'd out in a ditch!<br />

  Dear Captain Green,&mdash;This morning, I see,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Gazette</i> good news for you bears:&mdash;<br />
  "<i>On leave for six months to proceed to sea<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On urgent private affairs.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>To sea</i>" forsooth!  Pray what does this mean?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's surely some mystery here?<br />
  "<i>On urgent private affairs.</i>"&mdash;O Green,<br />

  Affairs at sea?  Ha!&mdash;I see through it now!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sly dog, you're in luck without doubt!&mdash;<br />
  Some coy little <i>mermaid</i> you chanced to know<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hooked on your voyage out?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O happy Green, is she blonde or brunette?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has she golden or raven tresses?<br />
  But will walking on land suit the tail of your pet?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope she judiciously dresses!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Her name?  Is she young?  Of course she can speak?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she wear her long hair in curls?<br />
  I trust she has got no scales on her cheek?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you marrying for love or for pearls?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I suppose Father Neptune will give her away?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure you, you have my best wishes.<br />
  I remain, yours,&mdash;C.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Salaams to all your Friend-Fishes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Herewith I send, of my friendship a token,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tortoise-shell comb from Galle;<br />
  A pocket mirror not easily broken,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A harp, and a squeaking doll.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In conclusion, dear Green, I may add that I wish<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew some sweet sub-marine girls:<br />
  I have no objections to marrying fish&mdash;<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coy and pale Annette,<br />
  A sweet French rose that blooms in Pondicherry.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Trichy next I came,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there another flame<br />
  Blazed for a little, then was quench'd in tears<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For soon I learnt, enraged,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Agnes was engaged<br />
  To Major Spooney of the Fusiliers.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why should I dilate<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further upon my fate<br />
  Of loving many maids but wedding none?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Maud my heart perplext,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Annie, Constance next,&mdash;<br />
  The last a widow, aged twenty-one?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough for me to say<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That now, though I grow gray,<br />
  My heart's as warm and tender as of yore.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, though my love burns bright<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sheds a softer light,<br />
  A milder radiance, mellowing evermore!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, not one, nor two,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every maid I view<br />
  I love, with love that widens with my years.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I pass away,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reader, weep not, but say,<br />
  <i>Chutney is with the cherubs&mdash;pretty dears!</i><br />

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
